    Python was designed to be easy to understand and fun to use (its name came 
    from Monty Python so a lot of its beginner tutorials reference it). Fun is a great motivator, 
    and since youâ€™ll be able to build prototypes and tools quickly with Python, many find coding in Python 
    a satisfying experience. Thus, Python has gained popularity for being a beginner-friendly language, 
    gand it has replaced Java as the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.
