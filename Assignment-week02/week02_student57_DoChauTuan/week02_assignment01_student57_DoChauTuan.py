a) Variable names are combination of uppercase letter or lowercase letter or _
    Python don not allow characters: @, $, % in name
b) correct names: half_pyramid, CheckRow,....
    incorrect names: tuanb@gmail, a%b, ....
c) E.g: even_list, odd_list, prime_numbers
Names of type variables introduced in PEP 484 should normally use CapWords preferring short names: T, AnyStr, Num. It is recommended to add suffixes _co or _contra to the variables used to declare covariant or contravariant behavior correspondingly
d) - numberofcollegestudents: LowerCase
   - NUMBEROFCOLLEGESTUDENTS: UpperCase
   - numberOfCollegeStudents: CamelCase
   - NumberOfCollegeStudents: PascalCase
   - number_of_college_students: SnakeCase
e) camelCase: a compound word that uses capital letters to delineate words. Does not include the first letter
E.g: someVariable, slackService, eventsRepo
   PascalCase: Pascal case follows the same camel case naming convention rules — all but one: we capitalize the first letter
E.g: SomeVariable, SlackService, EventsRepo
   SnakeCase: when all the words in a compound word are lower case but delimited by an underscore
E.g: some_variable, slack_service, events_repo
f) From my point of view I would prefer to choose SnakeCase style since it is more popular in coding and being used by a bunch of coders
