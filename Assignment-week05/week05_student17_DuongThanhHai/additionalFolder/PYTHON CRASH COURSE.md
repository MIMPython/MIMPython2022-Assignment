# **CHAPTER 01: GETTING START**

## **Setting Up Your Programming Environment**
Python differs slightly on different operating systems, so you’ll need to keep a few considerations in mind. Here, we’ll look at the two major versions of Python currently in use and outline the steps to set up Python on your system. 

### ***Python 2 and Python 3***
Today, two versions of Python are available: Python 2 and the newer Python 3. Every programming language evolves as new ideas and technologies emerge, and the developers of Python have continually made the language more versatile and powerful. Most changes are incremental and hardly noticeable, but in some cases code written for Python 2 may not run properly on systems with Python 3 installed. Throughout this book I’ll point out areas of significant difference between Python 2 and Python 3, so whichever version you use, you’ll be able to follow the instructions. If both versions are installed on your system or if you need to install Python, use Python 3. If Python 2 is the only version on your system and you’d rather jump into writing code instead of installing Python, you can start with Python 2. But the sooner you upgrade to using Python 3 the better, so you’ll be working with the most recent version.

### ***Running Snippets of Python Code***
Python comes with an interpreter that runs in a terminal window, allowing you to try bits of Python without having to save and run an entire program. Throughout this book, you’ll see snippets that look like this:
  > `print('Hello World!')` 
  *Hello World*
